    Assignment 2 part A Course Assignment of CS6910 Deep Learning IIT Madras
## Abstract<br/>
This assignment involves training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model** from scratch using the **iNaturalist12k dataset**. The goal of this assignment is to learn how to **tune hyperparameters** for optimal model performance and **visualize filters** to **gain insights** into the model's learning process. The process involves setting up the environment, preparing the dataset, defining the model architecture, training and evaluating the model, tuning the hyperparameters, and visualizing the filters.
## Dataset<br/>
The inaturalist12k dataset is a large-scale image classification dataset that contains over 12,000 species of plants and animals, with each species having at least 1,000 images. The dataset consists of high-resolution images, with each image being labeled with the corresponding species name. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with the training set containing 80% data, the validation set containing 20% data, and the testing set containing 1,930 species and 158,370 images.
## Objective<br/>
dataset and achieve high accuracy by tuning hyperparameters. Additionally, the assignment aims to visualize the learned filters to gain insights into how the model processes the images. Through this assignment, we will learn how to fine-tune hyperparameters, experiment with different model architectures, and interpret the results to improve model performance.
