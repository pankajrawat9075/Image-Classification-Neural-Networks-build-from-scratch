**Instructions to train and evaluate the neural network models:**

1.Install the required libraries in your environment using this command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. To train the neural network on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using cross-entropy loss, use the notebook: Deep_Learning_wandb.ipynb.

  a. In this notebook, to train using the best values for hyperparameters obtained from our use of the wandb sweeps functionality, do not run cells in the section titled "Hyperparameter tuning using Wandb". Run all the other cells of the notebook to train the model. Testing is done on the best parameter model.
  
  b. In order to run the hyperparameter search on your own, run the "Hyperparameter tuning using Wandb" section.
  
3. To train the model for the mean square error, just run the "Training the model on mean square error loss function" section
 
4. To run the 3 recommendations just run the cells for "Testing 3 models on MNSIT Dataset" section
